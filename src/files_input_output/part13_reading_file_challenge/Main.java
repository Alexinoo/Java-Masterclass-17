     * Challenge - Reading from a Text file
     *
     * Pick some text of your choice (from a doc, online article, some wiki page)
     * Read the text doc with one of the ()s we have covered
     * Pick whichever () you want, but your program shd do the following
     *
     *  - Tokenize the text into words, remove any punctuation
     *  - Ignore words with 5 char(s) or less
     *  - Count the occurrences of each word
     *  - Display the top 10 most used words
     *
     * The point of this exercise is to see if you can pick out what the articles
     *  might be about by simply getting the most used words
     *
     *
     * Bonus
     * After you use 1 (), try a 2nd ()
     * If you used a () that used a stream, try some code without a streaming () or
     *  vice versa
