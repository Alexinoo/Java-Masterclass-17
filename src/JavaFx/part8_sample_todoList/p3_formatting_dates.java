     * Formatting Dates
     * ................
     * Anytime we're displaying the date, we have to call toString() because the date is of type LocalDate
     * It would be nice if we can display the date in a slightly better format
     * Let's look at formatting that date, so it's a little bit easier to read, because for now it's hard to know which
     *  part of the date is the month or date
     *
     * DateTimeFormatter
     * ................
     * We'll call DateTimeFormatter and call ofPattern() on this class and store that in a "dtf" variable
     *  - Pass the format that we want our date to be formatted
     *  - call format() on the dtf variable and pass the deadline date
