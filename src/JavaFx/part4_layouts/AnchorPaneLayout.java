     * AnchorPane Layout
     * .................
     * This is another popular top level layout
     * Allows us to anchor children to its edges which can influence what happens when the pane is resized
     * For example
     *  - We might want to anchor a title to the top of the pane so that when the window is resized, a bunch of space isn't
     *    added between the title and the windows total bar
     *  - We could anchor a HBox containing buttons to the bottom of the pane
