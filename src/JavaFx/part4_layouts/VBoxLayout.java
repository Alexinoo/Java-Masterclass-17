     * VBox Layout
     * ............
     * Stacks controls vertically
     * Unlike the FlowPane, the controls will get cut off as we make the window smaller with a VBox
     *
     * Implementations
     *  - Added VBox layout with 10 buttons
     *
     * Resize the window upwards or downwards and compare this with a FlowPane layout
