    /*
     * Challenge #1
     * ............
     * - Set up test stubs
     *   - Create a JUnit test class that contains a test method for each method in the Utilities class
     *   - Don't add any test code to the methods yet
     *   - When you run the tests, they should all fail
     *   - Use the naming conventions we discussed in the JUnit lecture
     *   - Add JUnit4 library if you've created a new project
     *
     * Challenge #2
     * ............
     * - Add test code to the removePairs() test method, to test the Utilities.removePairs()
     *   - create tests for the Utilities.removePairs()
     *   - this () accepts a string and removes any pairs it contains by removing one half of the pair
     *   - Example:
     *      Input: AABCDDEFF - Output: ABCDEF
     *      Input: ABCCABDEEF - Output: ABCABDEF
     *   - Write the test code that tests the above 2 scenarios
     *   - Start by writing a test for the first set of input/output
     *   - Once that test passes, add a test for the second input/output pair
     *   - To keep things simple, you can add the same test method, but if you want to strict about it, you can create
     *     another method
